This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

== Dependencies

* PostgreSQL database
* ActiveMQ
* Description can be found in `src/main/asciidoc/README.adoc`

== Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

[source,shell script]
----
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev

----

NOTE:  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.


== Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

[source,shell script]
----
./mvnw package
----

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

[source,shell script]
----
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
----

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

== Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 

[source,shell script]
----
./mvnw package -Pnative
----

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 

[source,shell script]
----
*./mvnw* package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
----

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/firds-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.
